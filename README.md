# üìñ Project README: **P2P Online Meeting Platform using WebRTC**

---

## üìå Overview

This project is an **online meeting platform** designed for small group meetings (5‚Äì6 participants per meeting) using **WebRTC peer-to-peer (P2P)** connections for real-time audio/video communication.  
Our system is built to support **large-scale concurrent meetings** while ensuring user authentication, meeting management, and ephemeral meeting state storage for efficient and scalable operation.

We‚Äôve adopted a **Microservices Architecture** with lightweight APIs and Redis caching for optimal performance and scalability. The signaling process for WebRTC is handled via a dedicated signaling service, with **Firebase STUN/TURN servers** used for NAT traversal.

---

## üéØ Core Features  

- User Authentication using **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect**
- WebRTC-based peer-to-peer video/audio calls (5-6 participants per room)
- Create and join meetings via unique Meeting IDs
- Ephemeral meeting state management using **Redis**
- Persistent meeting metadata storage in **Database (MongoDB)**
- Meeting duration tracking and auto-expiry
- Host privileges (mute/remove participants)
- Load-balanced and horizontally scalable **Signaling Service**
- Failover-safe WebRTC connection setup via **Firebase STUN/TURN servers**
- Microservices APIs for meeting management, authentication, and signaling coordination

## üèÅ How to Run Locally ? 
- first you need install npm packages by running this command in terminal
```bash
npm i
```
- then run this command to start the application
```bash
npm start
```
- now open your browser and go to localhost:3000 to see the application.
- also you need to create certificates to run the application locally. you can use this [link](https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/) to get started.

## üìê System Architecture  

The system is built using a **Microservices Architecture**, with clear separation of concerns across the following services:

### üî∏ Authentication Service  
Handles user login, token generation (JWT), and token validation via OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect.

---

### üî∏ Meeting Manager Service  
- Creates and manages meetings  
- Tracks meeting durations and expiration  
- Updates Redis with current meeting and participant state  
- Stores persistent meeting metadata in the database  

APIs:
- `POST /meeting/create`
- `POST /meeting/join`
- `GET /meeting/{id}`
- `DELETE /meeting/{id}`

---

### üî∏ Signaling Server (WebSocket)
- Manages WebRTC signaling exchange (SDP offers/answers, ICE candidates)
- Uses Redis for fast lookups of meeting and participant connection details
- Relays signaling messages between clients until P2P connection is established

---

## üåê Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ User Authentication  
- User authenticates via OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect provider  
- Receives JWT for session authorization  

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create Meeting  
- Authenticated user sends a **create meeting request**
- Meeting Manager generates a unique meeting ID  
- Stores meeting metadata in **database**  
- Adds ephemeral meeting entry in **Redis**  
- Returns meeting ID to the user  

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Join Meeting  
- User provides meeting ID  
- Meeting Manager checks Redis for validity  
- Updates participant list in **Redis** and **Database**

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Signaling  
- Clients establish a WebSocket connection with the Signaling Server  
- Exchange SDP/ICE candidates until P2P WebRTC connection is established  
- STUN/TURN servers (via Firebase) assist in NAT traversal  

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Meeting Management  
- Host privileges:
  - Mute other users
  - Remove participants

- Track meeting duration via Meeting Manager
- Auto-expire meetings after duration, removing from Redis and Database  

---

## üìù Data Storage Plan

**Redis**
- Active meetings and participant session details
- Meeting TTL (Time-to-live)
- Ephemeral signaling info

**Database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)**
- User metadata  
- Meeting metadata  
- Historical meeting logs (optional)

## üì∂ Network Components

| Component         | Role                     |
|:-----------------|:-------------------------|
| Redis             | Fast cache for active meetings and connections |
| Firebase STUN/TURN | NAT traversal for P2P connectivity |
| WebSocket Signaling | WebRTC signaling and peer discovery |
| Database          | Persistent meeting records |
| Load Balancer     | Distributes signaling server traffic |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Future Improvements (Post-MVP)

- Host reassignment on disconnect (dynamic host switching)

- Recording support via server-side mix/minimal relay
- Meeting logs and statistics dashboard  
- Optional push notification service for meeting reminders
