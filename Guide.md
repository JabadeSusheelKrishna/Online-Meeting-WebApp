# Guide to Building the P2P Online Meeting Platform using WebRTC

This guide provides a step-by-step approach to building the online meeting platform described in the `project_plan.md`. It includes details on the architecture, server requirements, and implementation strategies for various components.

---

## Step 1: Understand the Architecture

The platform is based on a **Microservices Architecture**. Each service has a specific role, ensuring scalability and maintainability. The key components are:

1. **Frontend**: React-based web application for user interaction.
2. **Authentication Service**: Handles user login and token management using OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect.
3. **Meeting Manager Service**: Manages meeting creation, participant tracking, and metadata storage.
4. **Signaling Server**: Facilitates WebRTC signaling for peer-to-peer connections.
5. **Redis Cache**: Stores ephemeral meeting state and signaling data.
6. **Database**: Stores persistent meeting metadata and user information.
7. **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic across multiple instances of services.

---

## Step 2: Set Up the Development Environment

1. **Frontend**:
   - Use React with Vite for fast development.
   - Install dependencies: `npm install`.
   - Start the development server: `npm run dev`.

2. **Backend**:
   - Use Node.js for the backend services.
   - Install required packages for each service (e.g., Express, WebSocket, Redis client).

3. **Database**:
   - Use MongoDB or PostgreSQL for persistent storage.
   - Set up a local instance or use a managed database service.

4. **Redis**:
   - Install Redis locally or use a managed Redis cluster.

---

## Step 3: Implement the Services

### 1️⃣ Authentication Service
- **Purpose**: Authenticate users and issue JWT tokens.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect libraries (e.g., `passport.js`).
  - Expose endpoints like `/auth/login` and `/auth/validate`.
- **Deployment**: Deploy as a standalone service.

### 2️⃣ Meeting Manager Service
- **Purpose**: Manage meeting creation, participant tracking, and metadata storage.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use REST APIs for endpoints like `/meeting/create`, `/meeting/join`, etc.
  - Store ephemeral data in Redis and persistent data in the database.
- **Deployment**: Deploy as a standalone service.

### 3️⃣ Signaling Server
- **Purpose**: Facilitate WebRTC signaling (SDP offers/answers, ICE candidates).
- **Implementation**:
  - Use WebSocket for real-time communication.
  - Use Redis for fast lookups of meeting and participant details.
  - Use Google’s STUN server (`stun:stun.l.google.com:19302`) for NAT traversal.
- **Deployment**: Deploy as a standalone service.

---

## Step 4: Set Up Redis Cache
- **Purpose**: Store ephemeral meeting state and signaling data.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use Redis for storing active meetings, participant details, and signaling data.
  - Set TTL (Time-to-Live) for ephemeral data to ensure automatic cleanup.
- **Deployment**: Deploy a Redis cluster for high availability.

---

## Step 5: Set Up the Database
- **Purpose**: Store persistent meeting metadata and user information.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use MongoDB or PostgreSQL.
  - Design schemas for users, meetings, and logs.
- **Deployment**: Use a managed database service or deploy a database cluster.

---

## Step 6: Implement Load Balancing
- **Purpose**: Distribute traffic across multiple instances of services.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use Nginx or HAProxy as the load balancer.
  - Configure it to route traffic to the appropriate service instances.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the load balancer in front of the backend services.

---

## Step 7: Handle Replication and Scalability
- **Redis**:
  - Use a Redis cluster for high availability and scalability.
- **Database**:
  - Use a database cluster with replication for fault tolerance.
- **Signaling Server**:
  - Deploy multiple instances and use the load balancer to distribute traffic.

---

## Step 8: Deploy the Application

1. **Containerization**:
   - Use Docker to containerize each service.
   - Create Dockerfiles for the frontend, backend services, and Redis.

2. **Orchestration**:
   - Use Kubernetes (K8s) for managing containers.
   - Define deployment and service files for each component.

3. **Hosting**:
   - Use cloud providers like AWS, GCP, or Azure for hosting.
   - Use managed services for Redis, databases, and load balancing.

---

## Step 9: Test the Application
- Test each service independently.
- Test the integration of services.
- Perform load testing to ensure scalability.

---

## Step 10: Monitor and Maintain
- Use monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
- Set up alerts for service downtime or performance issues.
- Regularly update dependencies and services.

---

## Additional Notes
- Use Firebase STUN/TURN servers for NAT traversal.
- Implement host privileges (mute/remove participants) in the Meeting Manager Service.
- Use WebRTC APIs in the frontend for peer-to-peer connections.

By following this guide, you can build a robust and scalable online meeting platform. Each step ensures that the platform is modular, maintainable, and capable of handling real-time communication efficiently.
